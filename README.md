# Precise Secure AI
Precise Secure AI is a privacy-first tool that enables users to compute, query, or extract insights from large language models (LLMs) without disclosing any private or sensitive data. Built during my internship, this project explores secure AI interactionsâ€”balancing performance with confidentiality.

## Problem Statement
Modern LLMs are powerful but inherently require data input, which raises serious concerns in:

1. Data privacy

2. Enterprise compliance

3. Personal data protection

### Precise Secure AI ensures that user data never leaves the local environment, enabling secure querying and inference masking when interacting with public or third-party LLMs.

## Key Features
1. Privacy-Preserving Querying: Enables secure transformation and encoding of inputs before interacting with an LLM.

2. Modular Architecture: Easily plug in different LLMs or privacy methods (e.g., hashing, masking, encryption).

3. Real-time Inference: Maintains fast query turnaround without compromising security.

4. Visual Feedback: Clear indicators of data transformation and safety scoring.
